# F# Dice Roller

I found myself playing an RPG with some friends over Google Hangouts and was displeased with the
electronic dice rolling tools I had at hand.

I decided I need to write my own. BECAUSE OF COURSE I NEED TO WRITE MY OWN. And it should be
written in F#. And it should be a recursive descent parser. And it should be done with pattern
matching. And it should support expressions like "(2d6+1)*3".

This is the result. No warranties expressed or implied.
